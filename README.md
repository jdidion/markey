# MarKey

MarKey is a program for creating beautiful slide decks and posters from a Markdown document.

## Markdown

Markdown is a markup language that is quickly becoming popular due to its simplicity and readability. If you would like a nice introduction to Markdown, we suggest the [tutorial](http://markey.info/tutorial).

MarKey supports a superset of Markdown, provided by the [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked) parser. It also provides some extensions for advanced tables, LaTeX formatting, and a few other nice features.

## Getting Started

If you have Node.js installed already, you can install MarKey through npm:

    npm install markey

Otherwise, download the latest build for your OS [here](builds).
